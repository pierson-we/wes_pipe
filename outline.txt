fastq file
	QC fastq file (FastQC: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, FASTX-Toolkit: http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/commandline.html)
		Align reads (Bowtie2)
			Possible additional steps
				Sort/Index (Picard) (allows indexing of data in bam file. must sort first - don't know what the benefit for variant calling is)
				*MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar (Picard)
				*Indel Realignment - not required if using a haplotype assembly step (i.e.) mutect2(GATK)
				*Base Quality Score Recalibration (GATK, dbSNP: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/) https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_bqsr_BaseRecalibrator.php#--knownSites
			Variant Calling
				SNVs
					MuTect2 (defaults to using 4 threads for haplotypecaller)
						make sure germline resource is included.
					VarDict
					FreeBayes
						need to hack a filter to do paired somatic calling (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes/issues/107)
					VarScan
						need to convert .bam to pileup format (can pipe this data to VarScan, though) (http://varscan.sourceforge.net/somatic-calling.html)
				CNVs (Having normal samples will help correct for Exome capture biases)
					CNVkit
				InDels
					VarDict
					FreeBayes
					VarScan
						will need to postprocess varscan output (http://varscan.sourceforge.net/copy-number-calling.html)
					Scalpel
				Structural Variants
					LUMPY
					DELLY
					WHAM
			Variant filtering
			Variant Recalibration (GATK)
			Annotate Variants (ANNOVAR)
			Merge VCFs (picard)
			
			
TODO
max threads/processes management
cleaner input/output file param passing
clean up file hierarchy/names
error handling (mainly incomplete file deletion)
intuitive file structure for inputs (i.e. /project/case/normal/normal.fastq)
utilize luigi.Target tmp file functionality (https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/luigi.local_target.html)
defaults for threads/base_name/other variables
verbose mode
print stdout to log file
create quality check (against reference genome(s))
incorporate luigi workers functionality?
RGID in add read group - implement sample counter, or just use sample id
minimize saving duplicate files
add duplicates should be able to convert to bam and sort in one step
maximize efficiency by limiting as many steps as possible to regions specified in exome .bed file
make all command calls from separate fxn, incorporate threading
chromoplexy
clean up all parameters (cfg vs. passed)
add /tmp folder option (will delete all intermediate files once analysis is complete)
add num requested cpus to docker command
create linux and mac versions

create docker container
